# Chapter One

## How does Chipseq data analysis work? 

Where are the binding sites? 

- Peak calling allows us to determine this.

What genes are they associated with?

- Peak annotation 

How did the changes in conditions affect the binding?

- Differential Expression

We are leaking for peaks that represent immunoprecipitation (IP) fragments - Peak Calling.

- Good ChIP experiment produces more reads from IP fragemnts.



# Chapter Two
ChIP-Seq Workflow.

1. Quality Control (Trim adapters if necessary)
2. Align to genenome or transcriptome
3. ChIP specific quality control
4. Peak Calling (MACS2) on alignments(BAM/SAM) to generate a list of peaks.
